Alright, Space Voyager! Now that we're done with arrays and strings let's fuse them together in a real-time scenario. Here's your scenario:

Suppose you've got a list of words, let's say ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'mango', 'banana']. Each word could be repeated an arbitrary number of times. Think of this list as a conveyor belt in a space-age fruit factory. Now, your task is to identify the last unique fruit on the belt, i.e., the one that didn't repeat. If all the fruits are repeating, then there ain't any unique fruit, and your function should return an empty string ('').

Your function should take a list of strings (the conveyor belt of fruits) as input. Now, a string can be any word, not just a fruit name, and the list can have any number of strings. There could also be an edge case where the list has no strings at all (Empty conveyor belt, eh?). For output, your function should return the last unique string in the list or an empty string if there are not any of them.

To solve this task, you are expected to use sets. Sets are efficient for tracking seen and duplicate elements due to their fast membership testing capability.

Think you can deal with this, Space Voyager? Onwards!

def find_unique_string(words) :
# {
    # implement this
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    
    for i in words :
    # {
        # print(i)
        if (i in seen) :
        # {
            duplicates.add(i)
        # }

        else :
        # {
            seen.add(i)
        # }

    # }

    for i in range(len(words) - 1, -1, -1) :
    # {
        print(duplicates[i])
    # }

    return 0
# }

print(find_unique_string(['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'mango', 'banana']))  # It should print: 'mango'
# print(find_unique_string(['hello', 'world', 'hello']))  # It should print: 'world'
# print(find_unique_string(['hello', 'world', 'hello', 'world']))  # It should print: ''
# print(find_unique_string([]))  # It should print: ''

Great! Let's work through this together. Your current approach uses words.count() to check the frequency of each word, which can be inefficient. Instead, let's use sets to track seen and duplicate words.

Here's a hint to get you started:

Use two sets: one for words you've seen and another for duplicates.
Traverse the list from the start, adding words to the seen set. If a word is already in seen, add it to the duplicates set.
Traverse the list again from the end to find the last word not in duplicates.
Give it a try and let me know how it goes! ðŸš€

Good try, but that's not exactly right.

Your solution works for the test cases, but it doesn't use sets as intended, which would make it more efficient. Would you like some help with that? ðŸ¤”

# print('!', words.count(words[0]))
    result = ''

    for i in range(len(words) - 1, -1, -1) :
    # {
        # print(i, words[i], words.count(words[i]) % 2)
        
        if (words.count(words[i]) % 2 == 0) :
        # {
            None
        # }

        else :
        # {
            return words[i]
        # }

    # }

Are you ready to dive into some hashing practice with Python dictionaries, Space Voyager?

Let's imagine you're responsible for cataloging books in a spaceship library. Each book has a unique ID which corresponds to a specific title.

Your task is to run the code and observe how a dictionary processes these book IDs and titles. It will be akin to implementing a hash table. The code will demonstrate how addition, access, and deletion operations function within a dictionary, showing the key functionalities of a hash table.

'''

# Let's create a simple hash table in Python using dictionaries.

# We'll store information about books in a library, where each book has a unique ID (key) and corresponding title (value).

# Initialize an empty dictionary to serve as the hash table
book_library = {}

# Add some books to the dictionary
book_library[1] = "The Catcher in the Rye"
book_library[2] = "To Kill a Mockingbird"
book_library[3] = "1984"

# Print out the hash table/dictionary
print("Initial book library:")

for key, value in book_library.items() :
# {
    print(f"Book ID: {key}, Title: {value}")
# }

# Now, let's attempt to add a new book with an ID that's already used
book_library[1] = "Moby-Dick"

# Print out the updated dictionary
print("\nUpdated book library:")

for key, value in book_library.items() :
# {
    print(f"Book ID: {key}, Title: {value}")
# }

# Let's remove the book with ID 2 from the dictionary
del book_library[2]

# Print out the dictionary after deletion operation
print("\nBook library after deletion:")

for key, value in book_library.items() :
# {
    print(f"Book ID: {key}, Title: {value}")
# }

# The time complexity of adding, accessing, and deleting operations in a Python dictionary is O(1)

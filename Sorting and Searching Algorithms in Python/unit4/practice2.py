Alright, Voyager! Here comes your task: you are given a sorted array of floats with values like: [3.14, 3.14, 6.28, 9.42] - could be any size, even empty. You've also got a target float in your pocket, say, 3.14. Your mission, should you choose to accept it? You need to find the start and end coordinates where this target float appears in the list.

If the target decides to play hide-and-seek and isn't in the array, just return [-1, -1]! Oh, and your solution should be smarter and faster than 
O
(
n
)
O(n) time complexity. Is the jet fuel for that? Better buckle up!

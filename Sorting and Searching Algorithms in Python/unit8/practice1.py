Alright, Stellar Navigator, here's a scenario for you. Suppose you've got a list of integers, and you're hunting for the 
k
k-th largest cosmic gem — I mean integer — in that list. Now, remember, we're space-trotters, so when we say 
k
=
1
k=1, we're looking for the largest gem. For 
k
=
2
k=2, we're after the second largest, and so forth.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept two parameters: the list of integers and the index 
k
k. The list may contain duplicates, and 
k
k will always be between 1 and the size of the list.

Your output should be the 
k
k-th largest value, just like I taught you. And if two numbers are identical? Hey, remember, in this galaxy, they're considered the same no matter their position on the list!

import random

def find_kth_largest(numbers, k) :
# {
    if (numbers) :
    # {
        # implement this
        None
    # }

    else :
    # {
        return None
    # }

# }
        
def partition(nums, l, r) :
# {
    # implement this
    None
# }

print(find_kth_largest([3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], 2))  # Expected output: 5
print(find_kth_largest([3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6], 4))  # Expected output: 4

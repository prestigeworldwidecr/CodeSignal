You're almost ready to manage the inventory of a grocery shop on your own! Let's put everything you've learned into practice one last time. For this task, create a Python script to determine the maximum number of a single type of vegetable in the shop's inventory. Remember what you've learned about data aggregation with HashMaps!

'''

# TODO: Create a dictionary representing the inventory with vegetables as keys and their quantities as values
vegetable_inventory = {
                        "squash" : 7,
                        "carrot" : 12,
                        "onion" : 3
                        }

# TODO: Calculate the maximum number of a single type of vegetable in the inventory
max_vegetable = max(vegetable_inventory.values())

# TODO: Print out the maximum number of any vegetable in the inventory
print(max_vegetable)

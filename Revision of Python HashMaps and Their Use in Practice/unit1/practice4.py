Great job learning about HashMaps! Now, let's practice updating and accessing elements within a dictionary. Your task is to update the catalog with a new title for the 'mystery' genre, and then print it out. Remember, updating and accessing elements are crucial operations.

# Create a dictionary representing a small library catalog
library_catalog = {
                    "mystery" : "Sherlock Holmes",
                    "sci-fi" : "Dune",
                    "fantasy" : "Harry Potter"
                }

# TODO: Update the mystery book's title to 'Murder on the Orient Express' in the library_catalog
library_catalog["mystery"] = "Murder on the Orient Express"

# TODO: Print the new title of the mystery book
print(library_catalog["mystery"])

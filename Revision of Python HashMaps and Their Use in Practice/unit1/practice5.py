You're on the final step of understanding HashMaps using Python dictionaries. Dive into creating a simple library catalog: update book titles and print the updated catalog. Start from scratch and craft each part carefully.

# TODO: Create a dictionary named library_catalog with 'book1' and 'book2' as keys and their titles as values
library_catalog = {"book1" : "Parker Lewis Can't Lose",
           "book2" : "Firefly"
           }

# TODO: Update the title for 'book1' in the dictionary
library_catalog["book1"] = "Bad News Bears"

# TODO: Print the updated title for 'book1'
print(library_catalog["book1"])

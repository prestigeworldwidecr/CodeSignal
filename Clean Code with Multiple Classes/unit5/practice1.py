Welcome to the first task of our lesson on handling exceptions across classes! In this exercise, you will apply the principles of exception handling discussed in the lesson to refactor a simple banking application. Your goal is to enhance the codebase to preserve exception context and provide meaningful error messages while maintaining clean separation between logic and error handling.

The Current Problems

The current implementation has several issues with exception propagation:

It uses generic exceptions, leading to a lack of clarity.
Context is lost when re-throwing exceptions.
Error messages are not specific enough for effective debugging.
Refactor the code to implement robust exception handling.

Requirements

Introduce the following custom exceptions:

AccountException: This is a base exception class for all account-related errors. It should include a message for error details and an optional cause attribute to support exception chaining, preserving the context of why an error occurred.

AccountNotFoundException: Raised when an account does not exist. Inherits from AccountException and captures the account_id using an attribute self.account_id = account_id to indicate which account caused the error.

InsufficientFundsException: Raised when there are insufficient funds in an account. Inherits from AccountException and similarly captures the account_id.

TransferFailedException: A high-level exception for transfer-related failures that captures the underlying cause, allowing access to both the high-level failure reason and the specific lower-level cause.
Propagate exceptions across classes without losing the original context. Use the raise ... from ... syntax for chaining exceptions.

Ensure all error messages are clear, concise, and informative. Provide enough context for effective debugging.

Maintain a clean separation between business logic and error-handling code.

Good effort, but your solution is missing a few key requirements:

Your custom exceptions need to store the account_id and use clear, single-string messages.
Exception chaining (raise ... from ...) should be used for all relevant exceptions.
The main function should handle and print errors clearly.

Good effort, but your solution isn't quite there yet.

You need to catch the lower-level exceptions in transfer_funds and raise a TransferFailedException using raise ... from .... Also, make sure your error messages are strings, and handle exceptions in main() to print clear messages.

Good effort, but your solution is missing proper exception chaining and context preservation, and the main function doesn't handle or print errors as required.

Want to try fixing these issues, or do you need a hint?

Good effort, but your solution doesn't fully meet the requirements.

You need to improve how exceptions are chained and handled in the service layer, and make sure error messages are printed in main(). Want to try fixing these, or do you need a hint?

Great! Here are a few focused hints to help you move forward:

In your AccountService.transfer_funds method, you should catch exceptions like InsufficientFundsException and AccountNotFoundException (not TransferFailedException), and then raise a TransferFailedException using raise ... from ... to preserve the original context.
Your TransferFailedException should accept a message and a cause (the original exception), not just account IDs.
In your main() function, wrap the transfer calls in try/except blocks to print clear error messages if a transfer fails.
Try updating just one part at a timeâ€”start with exception handling in transfer_funds. Want a more specific example of how to catch and re-raise with context?

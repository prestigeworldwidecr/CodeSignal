Great job so far! Now, let's challenge you a bit more. Your task is to print the codes of the apartments on the first floor of our building. Here's a tiny challenge: Fill in the missing part to complete your task with minimal change. Remember, simplicity is key!

'''

# Creating a 2D array representing an apartment building
building = [["1A", "1B", "1C"], 
            ["2A", "2B", "2C"],
            ["3A", "3B", "3C"]]

# TODO: Complete the code to print the apartment codes of the first floor only.
for apartment in building[0] :
# {
    print(apartment, ' ')
# }

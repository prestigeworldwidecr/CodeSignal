/*

Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.



Example

For n = 2, the output should be
solution(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
solution(n) = 13.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] integer n

Guaranteed constraints:
1 â‰¤ n < 104.

[output] integer

The area of the n-interesting polygon.
